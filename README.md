>>Problem Statement:   Project is based on the problem of “Predicting prices of used cars?”. 
Real Life Scenario:
  • Assume you have a friend Sam, who wants to sell his car. 
  • But the problem is, he doesn’t know how much he should sell his car for?      
  • He wants to sell it for as much as he can; but he also wants to set the price reasonably so  someone would buy it.  
  • The Big Question is <b>“How can we help him determine the best price for his car?”</b>.
